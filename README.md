# Spam-Classifier


## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based spam classifier that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is designed to predict whether a given message is spam or ham (not spam). The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for tokenization and feature extraction. I have used Jupyter notebook for writing the code and I have shared my notebook with the name SpamClassifier.

## Features
**Naive Bayes Classifier** : Implements a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify messages as spam or ham.

**Tokenization** : Uses NLP techniques to preprocess and tokenize the text data.

**Training and Prediction** : Allows for training the model on a dataset and using the trained model to predict the class of new messages.

The dataset is available here:
